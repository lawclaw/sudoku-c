This is simply a rewrite of her approach and Python code into C  

---

## Changes
1. As C does not have a ```boolean``` type, ```int``` was used instead.
2. Likewise, ```None``` was replaced with ```-1```

---

## Build
### GCC (Linux)
Build  
```gcc -o sudoku sudoku.c```

```./sudoku```  
### Other compilers
You're on your own.
